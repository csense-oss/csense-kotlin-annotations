# Considerations
**Other annotations**
- String lengths  
- array lengths (also lists / collections)
- for testing only ?

**Range**
- added external annotations from within regular code (eg when selecting external code in your own project rather than having to navigate first.)
- do the range annotations from csense as the range annotation from jetbrains is. (so the dialog that pops up have range(s) in it.)
